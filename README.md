My first react-redux project <br/>
1st Juin - v0.9 (not stable, check bug list)<br/>
I stop this project to begin another one, the only goal of this project was to begin with redux and react

BUG:
-   
- Corner neighbourhood are not count
- Endgame do not make all zone clickable but only the last one showed

TODO:
-   
- Reset game to begin a new game
- Add to overlay : <br/>Size input<br/>Mine number input
- Timer and time saver
- Better endgame, with win or lose announcer
- Add unit tests
